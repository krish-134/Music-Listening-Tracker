# Music-Listening Tracker

## Proposal
This application will track the statistics for 
someone's *music-listening history* and will show graphs with this 
information. Music listeners who are interested in 
understanding their listening habits will enjoy using this application.
I myself decided upon this project because I love 
listening to music, and it seemed like this idea would pair nicely 
with programming.


*User Stories*
- As a user, I want to be able to *add* an **artist/band** and the **songs**
I heard to my listening history list
- As a user, I want to be able to *add* the **amount of time** I've spent listening
to a given song
- As a user, I want to be able to *view* the list of **artists/bands** on my listening history
- As a user, I want to be able to *view* the **amount of time** that I have spent
listening to a given **artist/band** or **song** from my listening history

*Phase Two User Stories*:
- As a user, I want to be able to *save* my **list of musicians** to file
- As a user, I want to be able ot *load* my **list of musicians** from file
- As a user, I want to be *reminded* about **saving my file** when I quit the program


# Instructions for Grader
- To add multiple Xs (Musicians/Songs) to a Y (music library or musician) click the 'add music' button in GUI, 
the prompts given by the program
- To add more music to the library, simply hit the 'add music' button again
- You can locate my visual component by clicking the "view statistics" button, but be sure to 
have some musicians in the library (either by loading or manually adding) in order to see a bar plot!
- There are two types of plots, the initial plot shown displays all the musicians in the 
library and the amount of time spent listening to each, but click the button saying 'find musician' to
display a plot of a particular musician in the library that shows their songs
- Save the state of the application by clicking the 'save current library' button in the main menu
- Reload the state of the application by clicking the 'load library' button from the main menu

# Music-Listening History Tracker

## Proposal
This application will track the statistics for 
someone's *music-listening history* and will show graphs with this 
information. Music listeners who are interested in 
understanding their listening habits will enjoy using this application.
I myself decided upon this project because I love 
listening to music, and it seemed like this idea would pair nicely 
with programming.
